# xyzreader - Material Design for Android

Applied Material Design to the Android application.
Improved UI of the application based on the Material Design rules.

App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).

App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.

App theme extends from AppCompat.

App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.

App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).

App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.

App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.

App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.

App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.

App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
